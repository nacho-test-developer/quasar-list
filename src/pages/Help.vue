    <p>The Daily Meeting (or Daily Scrum) is one of the key elements of Scrum and some other agile methods. It is set to happen every day of a Sprint (= a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed) in order to foster <strong>communication and collaboration between the whole team</strong>. In order to be effective, a Daily standup Meeting should follow these 8 rules.</p>

    <h5>8 rules to run effective Daily Standup Meetings:</h5>
    <p><strong>1 - Every day, same time, same place</strong></p>
    <p>It may seem obvious, but the very first rule to <strong>Daily Meetings is that it should happen every day of a Sprint</strong>, ideally at the beginning of a working day. Every team member must attend, as it helps to organize the work of the day and to make sure the team as a whole is working towards the completion of the Sprint objectives. It can also prevent two team members from working on the same task without knowing it.</p>

    <p><strong>2 - Stand up meeting AKA “Daily Scrum”</strong></p>
    <p>One of the <strong>core principles of the Daily Scrum is that it should happen standing up.</strong> It may seem a gimmick but it actually reduces rambling and helps team members staying focused. Being seated, it is very easy to take your laptop or smartphone out and start disengaging from the meeting. Moreover, standing up encourages everyone to keep the meeting short (ideally no more than 15 minutes) and focus on what’s important, keeping the discussions for after the meeting.</p>

    <p>An easy solution is to hold the meeting in a room without chairs or to put all the chairs on one side of the room.</p>

    <p>There are some exceptions here, some teams may comfortably sit down if they are using an online Scrum board; in that case, they share the screen, and everyone focuses on it.</p>
